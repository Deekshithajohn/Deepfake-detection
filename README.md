 With the proliferation of deepfake technology, distinguishing between genuine and machine
 generated content on social media has become increasingly challenging. This study addresses the
 problem of identifying deepfake tweets—those generated by artificial intelligence—by employing
 advanced deep learning techniques combined with FastText embeddings. Our approach leverages
 the robust capabilities of deep learning models to analyze textual patterns and the semantic richness
 provided by FastText embeddings to enhance detection accuracy. We propose a novel detection
 framework that integrates these methodologies to effectively classify tweets as authentic or machine
 generated. The results demonstrate significant improvements in detection performance, showcasing
 the potential of combining deep learning with contextual word embeddings to combat the growing
 issue of misinformation and digital manipulation on social media platforms.
